# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python
In the final course, we'll tie together the concepts that you’ve learned up until now. You'll tackle real-world scenarios in **Qwiklabs** that will challenge you to use multiple skills at once.

## 1. [Scale and convert images using PIL](https://github.com/jonathannava/google-it-automation/tree/main/images_PIL)

Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:

1. Open an image
2. Rotate an image
3. Resize an image
4. Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory 

## 2. [Process Text Files with Python Dictionaries and Upload to Running Web Service](https://github.com/jonathannava/google-it-automation/tree/main/upload_feedback_WS)
Introduction

You’re working at a company that sells second-hand cars. Your company constantly collects feedback in the form of customer reviews. Your manager asks you to take those reviews (saved as .txt files) and display them on your company’s website. To do this, you’ll need to write a script to convert those .txt files and process them into Python dictionaries, then upload the data onto your company’s website (currently using Django).

To do:
1. Use the Python OS module to process a directory of text files
2. Manage information stored in Python dictionaries
3. Use the Python requests module to upload content to a running Web service
4. Understand basic operations for Python requests like GET and POST methods 
5. You'll have 90 minutes to complete this lab.

## 3. [Automatically Generate a PDF and send it by Email](https://github.com/jonathannava/google-it-automation/tree/main/generate_PDF_send_email)
Introduction

You work for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.

To do
1. Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories
2. Generate a PDF using Python
3. Automatically send a PDF by email
